feat: Comprehensive review, refactor, and bugfix

This commit includes a wide range of improvements and fixes based on a full-project review.

- Refactored configuration loading to use Pydantic settings for a single source of truth.
- Centralized all secrets and configuration variables (DB, Google OAuth, JWT, etc.) into the settings module.
- Replaced all `print()` statements with structured logging for better monitoring.
- Pinned all dependencies in `requirements.txt` for reproducible builds.
- Fixed a critical `KeyError: 'role'` by adding the `role` column to the `users` table and schema.
- Resolved a complex series of Google OAuth2 bugs:
    - Corrected `redirect_uri_mismatch` by aligning `.env`, Google Console, and application access methods.
    - Resolved `invalid_request` (`device_id` required for private IP) by adding necessary parameters.
    - Fixed a subsequent `invalid_request` (`device_id` not for web apps) after moving to a `localhost` setup.
    - Identified and fixed a `401 Unauthorized` error by correcting the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    - Identified and provided a workaround for a system environment variable override issue.
- Refactored test suite to use `pytest` fixtures and assertions, and to clean up created files.
- Cleaned up `db/schema.sql` to contain only DDL statements.
- Fixed a `NameError` in `auth_router.py` caused by an accidental deletion during cleanup.
